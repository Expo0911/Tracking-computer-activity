  # Things I learned and might improve
    - 1.	Before using this “Rescue time” application, I have no idea about time spent on my computer.  I always map out my plans on a notebook and then carry out them. For example, I may plan to spend two hours doing programming homework using Python. After that, I take out my computer and do the two-hour homework. After close reviewing the detailed report, I am a little surprised about how planless I am. Even though I spend some time doing the homework, I may spend about at least 15% of my time doing other things like surfing the Internet, updating software or referring online materials. I think I need to pay more attention about and improve my effectiveness when using computers. Computers are part of our daily life, knowing more about the time spend on them is meaningful and useful. For me, I will check the report from “Rescue time” dashboard by the end of a day, to see if I am too lazy or inefficient.
    - 2.	I do not know how to write a markdown report (.md) before this homework. I think this homework is very helpful. At first, I thought just write something and name the file ended with md. Luckily, I googled about markdown file, then I realized that “Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents.” I spend about several hours learning how to use this language. One improvement I think should be done is that I need to make the report.md file more standardized using more functions and methods.
    - 3.	I learned how to upload files to Github repositories and using vim to editing text under command line. Before uploading files we should make comments first. I think I should improve the ability of using the vim by practicing more.
